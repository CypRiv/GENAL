Genal is a python module designed to make it easy to run genetic risk scores and mendelian randomization analyses. It integrates a collection of tools that facilitate the cleaning of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data and enable the execution of clinical population genetic workflows. The functionalities provided by genal include clumping, lifting, association testing, polygenic risk scoring, and Mendelian randomization analyses, all within a single Python module.

The module prioritizes user-friendliness and intuitive operation, aiming to reduce the complexity of data analysis for researchers. Despite its focus on simplicity, Genal does not sacrifice the depth of customization or the precision of analysis. Researchers can expect to maintain analytical rigour while benefiting from the streamlined experience.
